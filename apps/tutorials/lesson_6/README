README for Introduction to MoteWorks - Lesson 6: MyApp
Author/Contact: Crossbow Technology Inc.

Description:

MyApp is a basic application that starts a 1Hz timer and toggles the red
LED every time it fires. In addition the Light sensor is sampled and a message
is sent back to the base station. When the Light sensor has been sampled the
yellow LED is toggled. When the message has been sent to the base station the green
LED is toggled. This version uses the XMesh multi-hop routing service to send
messages back to the base station. This version is also configured to accept
commands from the base station to set the sampling rate and toggle the LEDs.
