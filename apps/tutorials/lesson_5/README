README for Introduction to MoteWorks - Lesson 5: MyApp
Author/Contact: Crossbow Technology Inc.

Description:

MyApp is a basic application that starts a 1Hz timer and toggles the red
LED every time it fires. In addition the Light sensor is sampled and a message
is sent back to the base station. The Light sensor is then sampled and a
message is sent to the base station. When the message has been sent to the base station 
the green LED is toggled. This version uses the XMesh multi-hop routing service to send
messages back to the base station expecting an acknowledgement in return. If the 
acknowledgement message is received the yellow LED is toggled.
