README for Introduction to MoteWorks - Lesson 3: MyApp
Author/Contact: Crossbow Technology Inc.

Description:

MyApp is a basic application that starts a 1Hz timer and toggles the red
LED every time it fires. In addition the Light sensor is sampled and a message
is sent back to the base station. When the Light sensor has been sampled the
yellow LED is toggled. When the message has been sent to the base station the green
LED is toggled. This application differs from Lesson 2 as the message is sent to
the base station over the radio.
